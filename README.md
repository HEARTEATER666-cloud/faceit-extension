# Faceit Deathnote

Faceit Deathnote is a Chrome extension + web platform built for the FACEIT CS2 community.

The idea is simple:

Players can search FACEIT profiles, view recent performance stats, and submit players into the Deathnote for funny, legendary or disastrous plays.

This project is inspired by old community-driven meme pages like CIS Deathnote, but built as a scalable product for global use.
